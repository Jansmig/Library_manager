# Library_manager

Library Manager is an application for managing library resources. The application logic is based on 4 entities: 
<br>Origin - library resource, has all the information such as: title, author, year of release, ISBN number, etc. It is the base for creation of each book copy.
<br>Book - a copy of the given Origin. For example, in the resources there is one Origin "Hobbit" and many of its copies (i.e. books), some of which are rented, some available etc.
<br>User – library's user
<br>Rental – books' rentals.
